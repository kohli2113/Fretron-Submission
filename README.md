# Fretron-Submission
This is my submission for Fretron's placement drive on 2/8/24.
There were 3 questions out -
1. in first Question I was not able to get the answer so i only plotted the routes taken by the flights
2. I performed the second question and completed it on my own. Just took the liberty to confirm the concepts and syntaxes from GeekforGeeks
3. I did not understand the third question and searched for the same at github and got an answer at https://github.com/Anshij98/Kill-All-And-Return-Home
